Intro to R25WebServices - CNET UserConference - 2012
====================================================

Source code for sample html reports from my presentation at the CollegeNET UserConference.

- Branch: Sample 1:  A very simple, empty html report utilizing null.xml.  This directory should live in your R25WS installation path/xslt.  You can then access the report by going to http://<your full r25ws url>/null.xml
	
- Branch: Sample 2: Sample 1 plus a meaningful query to R25WS for showing how to display some data using xslt

- Branch: Sample 3: Adding javascript as an example of dynamically pulling data once the report has been loaded into a browser

- Branch: Sample 4: Advanced example, showing how to execute a POST/PUT
